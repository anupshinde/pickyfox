Your brain just switched topics 6 times reading this sentence, didn't it?

Welcome to the club. While neurotypical productivity gurus tell us to "just focus," those of us with ADHD brains know it's not that simple.

Your browser probably looks like a digital hurricane hit it. Tabs scattered like confetti, bookmarks in three different organizational systems that made sense at 2am, and somewhere in that chaos is the thing you were actually looking for.

****🔥 Real Talk****  
Curated by someone whose Chrome currently has 94 tabs open and somehow still functions. These extensions work WITH your ADHD chaos, not against it. No neurotypical productivity guru nonsense here.

## Why Regular Productivity Tools Fail ADHD Brains

**Their assumption:** You'll remember to use the tool consistently.  
**Our reality:** We forget the tool exists 10 minutes after installing it.

**Their assumption:** You want to eliminate distractions.  
**Our reality:** Sometimes distractions ARE the work, and hyperfocus is the real enemy.

**Their assumption:** One system works for everyone.  
**Our reality:** We need 17 different systems because our brains change the rules daily.

## 🚀 Extensions for Tab Chaos (Because Closing Tabs = Losing Ideas)

### 1. OneTab - The Tab Hoarder's Best Friend

**What it does:** Converts all your tabs into a single list  
**Why ADHD brains love it:** You can hoard tabs without killing your computer  
**The magic:** One click saves all tabs, restores them later when you remember what you were doing

**Setup tip:** Pin this extension. You'll use it 47 times a day.

---

### 2. Tab Wrangler - Auto-Tab Cleanup for Scatter Brains

**What it does:** Automatically closes tabs you haven't used in X minutes  
**Why it's brilliant:** Works even when you forget it exists

**Pro tip:** It saves closed tabs in a list, so you can retrieve that thing you didn't realize you needed until 3 hours later.

---

### 3. Workona - Tab Workspaces for Project-Jumping Brains

**What it does:** Creates separate workspaces for different projects  
**ADHD superpower:** Switch between completely different contexts without losing your place  
**Real-world example:** Work tabs, side hustle tabs, "researching random hobby" tabs - all separate

**Why this matters:** When you get excited about a new project at 2pm, you don't have to abandon your morning work. Just switch workspaces.

**Setup strategy:** Create workspaces for your 3 main life areas, then let chaos happen within each space.

---

## 🎯 Focus Extensions (For When You Actually Want to Focus)

### 4. Forest - Gamified Focus for Dopamine-Seeking Brains

**What it does:** Plants virtual trees while you focus, kills them if you visit blocked sites  
**Why ADHD brains love it:** Turns focus into a game with immediate rewards  
**The psychology:** Visual progress + gamification + guilt about killing cute trees = focus magic

---

**What it does:** Saves web pages, articles, and screenshots with one click  
**ADHD superpower:** Captures ideas/research in the moment of discovery

---

## ⚡ Hyperfocus Management Extensions

### 8. Stretchly - Break Reminders for Hyperfocus Sessions

**What it does:** Forces breaks during long work sessions  
**Why ADHD brains need it:** Hyperfocus makes us forget basic human needs like water and bathroom breaks  
**Gentle approach:** Starts with suggestions, escalates to insistence

**The wake-up call:** "You've been coding for 6 hours without moving" is information your hyperfocused brain doesn't track.

**ADHD customization:** Set longer intervals than recommended. We're not neurotypical with our focus patterns.

---

### 9. RescueTime - Time Tracking for Time-Blind Brains

---

## 🔥 Chaos Management Extensions

## 🚫 What NOT to Install (ADHD Edition)

**Avoid these productivity extension types:**

- Anything that requires daily setup or maintenance
- Extensions with 50+ configuration options
- "Minimalist" tools that hide everything (we need visual cues)

**The rule:** If it takes more than 5 minutes to set up, your ADHD brain will abandon it.
