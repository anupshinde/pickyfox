When it comes to careers, most advice out there is either shallow  
(follow your passion!) or overwhelming (20 frameworks, 47 personality  
tests, and a spreadsheet to track it all). Let's keep it simple.

I want to share two lessons. The first tells you **what to do** in your  
career, the second tells you **how to know if it's the right one**.

## Part 1: What to Do in Your Career

Every career boils down to three questions:

1. Can you solve real problems?
2. Can you fulfill people's desires?
3. Do people feel satisfied after you're done?

Here's how to think about it:

- **Problems** are the burns of life. If you can bring relief where others only add to the pain, you'll stand out.
- **Solutions** are your tools. Your skills, your creativity, your ideas. Offer something unique instead of just copying what everyone else is doing.
- **Desires** are what people *wish* for. Sometimes, solving problems isn't enough. You need to leave people better off, fulfilled, not just fixed.
- **Feedback matters.** After you finish a project, look back. Did people feel satisfied? If yes, you're in the right lane. If not, adjust.
- **Hard work is non-negotiable.** No hacks will save you here. The best careers are built on sweat, not shortcuts.
- **Creativity is the multiplier.** Industries reward those who *create*. Whether it's products, designs, strategies, or systems. If you can build something new, you'll never run out of opportunities.

The career you should choose is the one where you can consistently solve  
problems, fulfill desires, and work hard at creating something unique.

## Part 2: How to Know If It's Truly Yours

Here's the trick most people miss: It's not enough to be *good at  
something*. You need to know *why* you're good at it. That's where  
**analysis** comes in.

Think of it this way:

- Anyone can follow the steps. Few can separate what's valuable from what's noise.
- If you can analyze a task. Pull apart the "milk" (essence) from the "water" (fluff). You don't just do the job, you *own* it.
- Analysis leads to experimentation. Experimentation leads to new solutions. New solutions lead to desire fulfillment. That's the real cycle of growth.

So test yourself:

- Which tasks do you memorize, and which ones do you *understand*?
- Where do you naturally start experimenting instead of just copying?
- In which areas do you end up creating new solutions rather than repeating old ones?

That's your compass. If you can analyze, improve, and create in a field,  
that's your field. If you can't, no amount of passion will save you.

## The Bottom Line

Don't pick careers based on hype or pressure. Choose the ones where  
you:

- Solve problems people actually feel.
- Fulfill desires that make them satisfied.
- Work hard while staying creative.
- Naturally analyze, improve, and create.

If you can check all those boxes, you've found the work that's truly  
yours.
