Drowning in decisions while your brain spins like a broken washing machine?

I know that feeling. When everything seems urgent, every choice feels wrong, and your to-do list is breeding faster than you can kill it. Your mind jumps between problems without solving any of them, like a ping-pong ball in a tornado.

Most advice about overwhelm is either too vague ("just breathe and prioritize") or too complex (detailed productivity systems that take hours to set up). What you need in overwhelming moments are simple mental tools that cut through the noise.

Mental models are thinking frameworks that help you process information and make decisions more effectively. They're like having a calm, wise friend in your head who can see the situation clearly when you can't.

**Battle-tested by someone who goes from "everything is on fire" to "okay, I can handle this" using these specific thinking tools.**

## Why Your Brain Gets Overwhelmed

**Information overload:** Too many inputs competing for attention  
**Decision fatigue:** Every choice depletes your mental energy  
**Threat detection:** Your brain interprets overwhelm as danger and shuts down higher thinking  
**Pattern matching failure:** When situations feel new and complex, your brain can't quickly categorize them  
**Future focus anxiety:** Thinking about everything that could go wrong instead of what you can control now

**The solution:** Simple frameworks that help you categorize, prioritize, and act even when your brain is fried.

## 🎯 Immediate Overwhelm Relief Models

### The "Triage" Framework

**Borrowed from:** Emergency medicine  
**Use when:** Everything feels urgent and important  
**The model:** Categorize tasks like emergency room patients

**Categories:**

- **Critical:** Will cause real damage if not handled today
- **Urgent:** Important but can wait 24-48 hours
- **Stable:** Important but flexible timing
- **Can wait:** Won't matter if delayed by a week

**Application:** List everything overwhelming you, then sort into these categories. Start with critical, ignore "can wait" completely.

**Reality check:** Usually only 1-2 things are actually critical.

---

### The "10-10-10 Rule"

**Borrowed from:** Decision science  
**Use when:** Stuck between choices or paralyzed by consequences  
**The question:** How will I feel about this decision in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years?

**Examples:**

- **Saying no to extra project:** 10 minutes (guilty), 10 months (relieved), 10 years (doesn't matter)
- **Taking a mental health day:** 10 minutes (anxious), 10 months (grateful), 10 years (doesn't matter)
- **Having difficult conversation:** 10 minutes (uncomfortable), 10 months (glad I did it), 10 years (doesn't matter)

**Insight:** Most daily stresses matter way less over time than they feel right now.

---

### The "Circle of Control" Model

**Borrowed from:** Stephen Covey  
**Use when:** Feeling helpless and anxious about outcomes  
**The framework:** Sort concerns into three circles

**Inner circle (full control):** Your actions, responses, effort, attitude  
**Middle circle (influence):** Other people's decisions through your actions  
**Outer circle (no control):** Weather, economy, other people's choices, past events

**Application:** Focus 90% of energy on inner circle, 10% on influence circle, 0% on outer circle.

**Overwhelm reducer:** Realizing how much you DON'T need to control is liberating.

## 🧠 Decision-Making Models for Clarity

### The "Good Enough" Principle

**Borrowed from:** Behavioral economics (satisficing vs. maximizing)  
**Use when:** Perfectionism is paralyzing you  
**The concept:** Aim for decisions that meet your criteria, not perfect decisions

**How to apply:**

1. **Define "good enough" criteria** before researching options
2. **Choose the first option** that meets all criteria
3. **Stop researching** once you've decided
4. **No second-guessing** unless new major information emerges

**Example:** Choosing a restaurant that's clean, has food you like, and fits your budget vs. researching every restaurant in the city for the "perfect" meal.

---

### The "Opportunity Cost" Frame

**Borrowed from:** Economics  
**Use when:** FOMO is making every choice feel wrong  
**The question:** What am I giving up to choose this option?

**Application:**

- **Saying yes to this meeting** = Giving up focused work time
- **Scrolling social media** = Giving up reading, exercise, or rest
- **Working late tonight** = Giving up time with family or sleep

**Clarity boost:** Makes trade-offs explicit instead of hidden.

---

### The "Regret Minimization" Framework

**Borrowed from:** Jeff Bezos  
**Use when:** Making big life decisions  
**The process:** Project yourself to age 80 and ask which choice you'd regret NOT trying

**Examples:**

- **Starting a business:** Will regret not trying more than trying and failing
- **Moving to new city:** Will regret not experiencing it more than potential discomfort
- **Having difficult conversation:** Will regret not speaking up more than temporary awkwardness

**Best for:** Major life choices, not daily decisions.

---

## 🔧 Productivity Models for Action

### The "Next Action" Method

**Borrowed from:** David Allen (Getting Things Done)  
**Use when:** Big projects feel overwhelming and unclear  
**The question:** What's the very next physical action required to move this forward?

**Examples:**

- **"Plan vacation"** → Next action: "Google flights to Portland"
- **"Get healthy"** → Next action: "Put workout clothes by bed"
- **"Improve finances"** → Next action: "Log into bank account"

**Why it works:** Concrete actions are less overwhelming than abstract goals.

---

### The "Energy-Task Matching" Model

**Borrowed from:** Ultradian rhythm research  
**Use when:** Everything takes longer than expected  
**The framework:** Match task difficulty to your current energy level

**High energy tasks:** Creative work, difficult conversations, complex problem-solving  
**Medium energy tasks:** Planning, organizing, routine work  
**Low energy tasks:** Email, data entry, simple administrative work

**Application:** Stop forcing high-energy tasks when you're mentally depleted.

---

### The "Batching" Principle

**Borrowed from:** Manufacturing efficiency  
**Use when:** Constant context switching is exhausting  
**The method:** Group similar tasks and do them all at once

**Examples:**

- **Communication batch:** All emails, texts, and calls in one session
- **Decision batch:** Plan meals for the week instead of deciding daily
- **Admin batch:** Pay bills, update calendar, file documents together

**Mental benefit:** Reduces the cognitive load of constantly switching between different types of thinking.

---

## 🎪 Stress Response Models

### The "Zoom Out" Technique

**Borrowed from:** Stoic philosophy  
**Use when:** Current problems feel enormous  
**The exercise:** Imagine viewing your situation from increasing distances

**Levels:**

1. **From across the room:** How big does this problem look?
2. **From space:** Can you even see this problem from orbit?
3. **From history:** Will this matter in 100 years?
4. **From death bed:** What will you remember about this time?

**Perspective shift:** Most daily stresses shrink dramatically with distance.

---

### The "Both/And" Framework

**Borrowed from:** Dialectical thinking  
**Use when:** Stuck in black-and-white thinking  
**The approach:** Hold two seemingly contradictory truths simultaneously

**Examples:**

- **I'm overwhelmed AND I'm capable of handling this**
- **This situation sucks AND I can learn from it**
- **I'm behind on goals AND I'm making progress**
- **I feel scared AND I can take action anyway**

**Overwhelm relief:** Reduces pressure to have everything figured out perfectly.

---

## 📊 Planning Models for Sanity

### The "Single Priority" Rule

**Borrowed from:** Warren Buffett  
**Use when:** Everything feels equally important  
**The method:** Choose ONE priority for the day/week/month and defend it

**Process:**

1. **List everything** that feels important
2. **Pick the single most important** item
3. **Treat everything else** as "not today" items
4. **Protect the priority** from other demands

**Paradox:** Doing less often accomplishes more than trying to do everything.

---

### The "Time Boxing" Model

**Borrowed from:** Agile development  
**Use when:** Tasks expand to fill available time  
**The framework:** Assign fixed time blocks to activities

**Examples:**

- **Email:** 30 minutes maximum, twice daily
- **Planning:** 15 minutes each morning
- **Socializing:** 1 hour lunch break, not all day
- **Research:** 45 minutes maximum before making decision

**Benefit:** Creates artificial urgency that improves focus and prevents perfectionism.

---

## 🚫 When Mental Models Don't Help

**During acute mental health crises:** Professional help is needed  
**When overwhelmed by grief or trauma:** Processing emotions comes before productivity  
**During physical illness:** Rest and recovery take priority  
**When basic needs aren't met:** Address food, sleep, and safety first

**Remember:** Mental models are tools for normal overwhelm, not substitutes for professional support when needed.

## 🔄 Building Your Mental Model Toolkit

### Start with Three Models

**Choose one from each category:**

1. **Overwhelm relief:** Triage, 10-10-10, or Circle of Control
2. **Decision making:** Good Enough, Opportunity Cost, or Next Action
3. **Stress response:** Zoom Out, Both/And, or Single Priority

### Practice During Calm Moments

**Don't wait for overwhelm to try these tools**

- **Practice triage** on a regular to-do list
- **Use 10-10-10** for small decisions
- **Apply zoom out** to minor annoyances

### Create Quick Reference

**Write down your favorite frameworks** in simple language you can access when stressed  
**Example card:**

- Overwhelmed? → Triage (Critical/Urgent/Stable/Wait)
- Can't decide? → How will I feel in 10 minutes/months/years?
- Stressed? → What can I control right now?

## The Meta-Model: Choosing Which Model to Use

**For immediate relief:** Triage or Circle of Control  
**For decisions:** 10-10-10 or Good Enough  
**For planning:** Single Priority or Time Boxing  
**For perspective:** Zoom Out or Both/And  
**For action:** Next Action or Energy-Task Matching

**The key:** Having a small toolkit you know well beats having many models you forget under pressure.

*Feeling overwhelmed right now?* Try the Triage framework on whatever's stressing you most, then [get in touch](/contact/) with how it goes - I love hearing which mental models resonate with different people.
