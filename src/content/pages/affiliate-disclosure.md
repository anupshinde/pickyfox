### What Are Affiliate Links?

Some of the links on PickyFox are affiliate links. This means that if you click on a link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission — at no additional cost to you.

Affiliate programs are a common way for websites to cover operating costs and continue providing free content.

### How We Use Affiliate Links

- Links may go directly to a product or service, **or indirectly through a partner site or link management tool**.
- Regardless of how the link is structured, if you make a purchase, PickyFox may receive a commission.
- Affiliate partnerships do not influence our editorial choices. We aim to recommend tools, books, and resources that we believe are useful to readers.

### Your Experience

- Using an affiliate link does not change your price.
- Cookies or tracking may be used by the affiliate partner to attribute purchases to PickyFox.
- Please review the privacy policies of those third-party sites for details on how they handle your data.
