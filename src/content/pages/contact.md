**I love hearing from fellow seekers who are navigating the chaos of productivity advice and life optimization.**

Whether you've discovered something brilliant, need help with a specific challenge, or just want to share your wins (and spectacular failures), I'm here for it.

## Why Reach Out?

**Share Your Wins:** Found a tool that changed everything? Implemented a system that actually stuck? I collect these stories because they help other readers know what's working in the real world.

**Ask Questions:** Stuck between two apps? Can't figure out if a system will work for your situation? I've probably tested it or can point you toward someone who has.

**Suggest Topics:** What problems are you wrestling with? What tools do you wish someone would review? Your suggestions often become my next deep dives.

**Tell Your Story:** Sometimes you just need someone to understand why you tried 47 different to-do apps last month. I get it. We've all been there.

## How to Reach Me

Send me a note through the [**Contact Form**](https://forms.gle/yqLBPrSjtoMg5Aku5).

OR

**X (Twitter):** [@pickyfoxHQ](https://x.com/pickyfoxHQ) (DMs open)

This goes straight to me - no assistants, no chatbots, just a real human who probably has strong opinions about the productivity tool you're considering.

**Response Time:** I aim to respond within 2-3 business days. Sometimes faster if you catch me during a productive streak, sometimes slower if I'm deep in testing mode with notifications turned off.

**Discord:** Private community (coming soon). I’m setting this up as a more interactive space, but it’s not open just yet.

## What to Expect

**Real responses from a real person.** I read every message personally. If you take the time to write, I'll take the time to give you a thoughtful response.

**Honest opinions.** If I think the tool you're excited about is overhyped, I'll tell you (kindly). If I think you're overthinking something, I'll tell you that too.

**No sales pitches.** I'm not trying to sell you anything. I don't have courses, coaching programs, or affiliate partnerships that bias my recommendations.

**Sometimes I don't know.** If you ask about something I haven't tested, I'll say so. But I might point you toward someone who has, or add it to my testing list.

## What I Love Hearing About

- **Success stories:** "I finally found a system that works!" messages make my day
- **Tool discoveries:** Found something amazing that's flying under the radar? Tell me about it
- **Epic failures:** Sometimes the best lessons come from spectacular crashes
- **Real-life context:** How you adapted advice to work with kids, irregular schedules, or whatever chaos your life throws at you
- **Simple questions:** "Should I use Notion or Obsidian?" is exactly the kind of question I love diving into

## What Works Best

**Be specific.** Instead of "What productivity system should I use?" try "I'm a freelancer with ADHD who struggles with project management - what would you recommend?"

**Share context.** Tell me about your situation, what you've tried, what didn't work, and what you're hoping to achieve.

**Don't overthink it.** A quick "Hey, tried your book recommendation and it changed everything, thanks!" is perfect.

## A Few Guidelines

**One topic per message** helps me give you better answers. If you have three different questions, send three different messages.

**Include relevant details** like what devices you use, what tools you've already tried, or what specific problem you're trying to solve.

**Be patient with responses.** I'm usually testing something new, which means I might be in "deep work mode" with limited message checking.

## Not Sure What to Say?

Here are some conversation starters:

- "I just tried [tool/book/system] and here's what happened..."
- "I'm struggling with [specific problem] and wondering if you've encountered this..."
- "Found this new app/book/approach and thought you might want to check it out..."
- "Your post about [topic] made me think of [related experience]..."
- "Quick question about [specific tool or strategy]..."

## What Happens Next?

When you message me, here's what typically happens:

**I read it** (usually within 24 hours, even if I don't respond immediately)

1. **I think about it** (sometimes this involves testing something new or digging into research)
2. **I respond thoughtfully** (might include follow-up questions, resource recommendations, or just genuine engagement with your story)
3. **Sometimes magic happens** (your question becomes a blog post, your discovery gets shared with other readers, or we start a great ongoing conversation)

## The Fine Print

**Privacy:** I respect your privacy completely. I'll never share your personal information or use your stories without explicit permission.

**Response guarantee:** While I read everything, I can't guarantee responses to every single message, especially during busy periods. But I do my best.

**No emergency support:** This isn't a customer service line. If you're having a crisis, please reach out to appropriate professional resources.

## Beyond DMs

While DMs and contact forms are the best way to reach me directly, you might also find answers in:

- **The blog archives** - I've probably written about your question
- **Previous reader conversations** - many posts start as reader messages
- **The search function** - seriously, I write about a lot of specific tools and situations

## Let's Connect

The best part of running PickyFox isn't finding the perfect productivity system (spoiler: it doesn't exist). It's connecting with other people who are thoughtfully navigating the same challenges.

Your wins inspire other readers. Your questions help me write better content. Your discoveries expand everyone's toolkit.

**So don't be shy.** Whether you're a long-time reader or stumbled across the site five minutes ago, I'd love to hear from you.

The quickest way to get in touch is through the [**Contact Form**](https://forms.gle/yqLBPrSjtoMg5Aku5).

You can also DM me on [**X (Twitter):** @pickyfoxHQ](https://x.com/pickyfoxHQ) (DMs open)

Thanks for being part of this community of curious, picky people who refuse to settle for productivity theater.

**Discord:** Private community (coming soon).

*P.S. - If you're writing to tell me about a tool that will "revolutionize my workflow," please include what specific problem it actually solves. Generic enthusiasm gets filed under "probably marketing." Specific use cases get my full attention.*
